To build this example, CUnit must be installed in your environment,
it can be downloaded from: http://sourceforge.net/projects/cunit/files/CUnit/

To view CUnit XML result files in your browser, copy the *.dtd and *.xsl files
provided by CUnit in the same folder as the XML files.
On a default CUnit installation, those files are in /usr/local/share/CUnit/
folder.
